- In "yolactDemo" dont forget to chooose the right IP
- If you want to choose the mode of speaking (i.g Pepper answering questions), change "subprocess.run(["python2", fileName, '--speak_constantly=True'])" to "subprocess.run(["python2", fileName, '--speak_constantly=False'])"
- If nothing works - relax and try again, the hardest is to start ;)

How to start the application (if you have installed everything)
cd pepper_yolact
conda activate ciirc_gym
python3 pepper_yo.py
